Program Assignment 2

Web Server

Introduction

In this assignment, a web server is developed and is able to handle the GET method sent from web browser and/or http programs, e.g. telnet.
The connetion is established with TCP socket. The server spawns a thread to handle the event once the link is connected.The server gets 
the string of the request and evaluates the method. The method GET is the only one implemented, and the associated data are sent to 
the client. The error message is sent back to the client if the method sent is not GET. 
The most complicate tasks in this assignment are to handle different methods, to predict the possible negative events that might
crash the program, and to use the buffer sufficiently. 
A Makefile is included and uses pthread to compile the program. 

Build
